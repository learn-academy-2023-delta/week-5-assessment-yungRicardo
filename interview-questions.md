# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What does calling super do in a Ruby class?

Your answer: Calling a superclass passes information to a subclass that will access data from the superclass. A class inherits from another class.

Researched answer: Calling super is used to call the superclass's implementation of a method. When super is invoked within a subclass method, it searches for the same method in the superclass and calls it.

2. What is a gem?

Your answer: a gem is packaged library that provides a unique type of functionality and can be easily combined with projects. It allows developers to enhance their applications and simplify tasks.

Researched answer: a gem is a packaged library that provides specific functionality and can be easily incorporated into Ruby projects. Gems are essentially collections of code, documentation, and metadata that are distributed and shared within the Ruby community.


3. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: a relational database organizes data into tables with predefined relationships between them. Data is stored in structured tables made up of rows and columns. Other types of databases are Object-Oriented database.

Researched answer: A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. There are four kinds of this database: document databases, key-value stores, column-oriented databases, and graph databases.

4. What are primary keys? Why purpose does a primary key serve?

Your answer: a primary key is a column or set of columns in relational database that identify each row in a table. Their purpose is to uniquely identify each record and make sure there are no duplicates.

5. What are the five HTTP verbs? What is each verb's corresponding CRUD action?

Your answer:

The 5 HTTP verbs are POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively.
The CRUD actions map to the HTTP methods, providing a efficient way to interact.

Researched answer: 

GET: Retrieve data 
POST: Submit data to create new resources 
PUT: Update an entire existing resource 
PATCH: Partially update an existing resource
DELETE: Delete an existing resource 
HTTP verbs correspond to CRUD operations used in database systems, providing a standard way to excute Create, Read, Update, and Delete actions on resources over the HTTP protocol.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Model validations: Model validations are rules or conditions that are applied to the attributes of a model in a web application to ensure the correctness and integrity of the data being saved to the database.

2. RESTful routes: are a convention for designing and structuring the endpoints or URLs of a web application's API in a RESTful manner.

3. ERB: (Embedded RuBy) is a templating system in Ruby that allows embedding Ruby code within HTML, XML, or any other text-based documents. It provides a way to generate dynamic content by combining static text with Ruby code.

4. Params: refers to the parameters or data that are sent as part of an HTTP request. It contains information that is passed from the client (such as a web browser or a mobile app) to the server. 

5. API: stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.
